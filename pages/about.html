    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <p>
        My journey began in 2009 when it became clear that my oldest child had many, many <i>allergies</i> to both skincare products and food. 
        Finding soap--and especially, lip balm--he could use was extremely difficult. 
        I searched and searched for a company that offered an <em>allergen free</em> product <i>and</i> production line and just could not find it. 
        I started making soap and lip balm just to have something safe to use on my children.  
    </p>

    <p>
        One day, I realized many others were in the same boat, so <strong>Allergy Mama</strong> was born.
