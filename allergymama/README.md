# AllergyMama
Hello world! This is the first website I have ever built from scratch. It's my Code Louisville Front End Web Development (read, BEGINNER) student project, wherein I attempt to makeover my friend's website where she sells soap and other allergy-friendly skincare products. Fingers crossed it comes out looking better than the previous iteration . . .
