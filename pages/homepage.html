                <h2>Our history</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey began in 2009 when it became clear that my oldest child had many, many <i>allergies</i> to both skin products and food. 
                    Finding soap and especially lip balm he could use was extremely difficult. 
                    I searched and searched for a company that offered an <i>allergen free</i> product <b>and</b> <i>production</i> line and just could not find it. 
                    I started making soap and lip balm just to have something safe to use on my children.  
                    One day, I realized many others were in the same boat, so <b>Allergy Mama</b> was born.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    My vision and promise to all people, parents and my children, is that I will make a product that is allergen, gluten and fragrance free every time.  
                    All equipment was purchased new and is dedicated to production.  I want you to feel safe with the product that I make. 
                </p>
