# AllergyMama
Hello world! This is the first website I have ever built from scratch. It's my Code Louisville Front End Web Development (read, BEGINNER) student project, wherein I attempt to makeover my friend's website where she sells soap and other allergy-friendly skincare products. Fingers crossed it comes out looking better than the previous iteration . . .

My version of the Allergy Mama website uses a variety of CSS styles and properties for a responsive layout that adjusts to 3 different screen widths, as well as a couple of JavaScript functions that can be used for site navigation on mobile devices and relatively small screens. 

Noteworthy CSS features include:
1. A 'sticky' navigation bar that stays at the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the page.
2. A 'hamburger' menu icon that appears at typical mobile device screen sizes and transforms into an 'X' as the user clicks it to open the site navigation menu.
3. A flex grid containing photos in flex boxes that resize and change from a 2x2 to a 4x1 layout on mobile and desktop screens, respectively. The photos have a translucent overlay that appears when the user hovers over them. Inside the overlays are links to live Shopify webpages where Allergy Mama products can be purchased.

Last, but not least, the JavaScript:
1. When the user clicks on the hamburger icon, a JavaScript function is triggered, which causes a navigation menu to 'slide' in. 
2. Another JavaScript function makes the nav menu disappear when the user clicks on a link within it or on the 'X' that transforms back into the hamburger.
